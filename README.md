# AM-UpdateTopology
A small tool for SDL Web that examines all of your Publications and ensures that the Topology Manager (and thus Discovery Service) has the right Synchronization Target set.

Before you can build this solution, you'll need to copy the following files from your SDL Web installation to the References folder:
- Tridion.AudienceManagement.DomainModel.dll
- Tridion.ContentManager.CoreService.Client.dll
