# AM-UpdateTopology
A small tool for SDL Web that examines all of your Publications and ensures that your CD environments have the right Audience Manager Synchronization Target set 
(as selected on the Properties of each Publication).
 
Before you can build this solution, you'll need to copy the following files from your SDL Web installation to the References folder:
- Tridion.AudienceManagement.DomainModel.dll
- Tridion.ContentManager.CoreService.Client.dll
